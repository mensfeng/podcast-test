His approach combines cutting-edge technology, creativity, and a deep understanding of safety principles to craft solutions that make a tangible difference in people's lives.

## Projects

### Project 1: Smart Helmet for Construction Workers

![Smart Helmet](smart_helmet.jpg)

Construction sites can be hazardous environments, but Mens Feng believes in equipping workers with the best tools for safety. This project involves the development of a smart helmet embedded with sensors and IoT technology. The helmet monitors vital signs, detects hazardous gases, and alerts workers to potential dangers in real-time. By providing proactive safety measures, this smart helmet not only protects workers but also enhances productivity on the job site.

### Project 2: AI-Powered Fire Detection System
