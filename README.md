# Safety Engineering Readme

<img src="images/Safety.png" width="250">

Hey everyone! For me, committing to product safety is like an adrenaline boost. Making lives easier, safer, and better is my ultimate vision. Right now, I'm diving into Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) to build a detailed system database for a machine. Maybe one day I can make a LLM AI with these data. I'll be sharing my progress and interesting links I find along the way. Join me on this exciting journey!

## 2. Projects

### 2.1 Automatic Welding Tip Changing Machine

![Smart Helmet](smart_helmet.jpg)

- Leading the development of an automated system that can replace the weld tip on a welding robot, reducing both production cycle time and the need for human intervention

- Adapting industrial communication protocols to better suit the factory environment and ensure safe communication with existing machines through a handshake mechanism

### 2.2 Walking Cane

![Fire Detection](fire_detection.jpg)

Successfully designing and crafting a walking cane for the average Canadian, integrating CNC milling and turning operations, and validated the structural integrity through Finite Element Analysis (FEA)
